Description:
1. A FPS creature capture game.
You should try to capture creatures living in the desert and oasis. If all types of creatures are captured, you win. However, the creature can get aggressive and attack players. If your health goes to 0, you lose.
There are magic balls in this world. You are a master in magic and you can throw purple magic balls to capture creatures. Creatures can throw pink balls to attack you. Some air creatures like yellow balls and will rotate around them.

2. All functional requirements mentioned in the assignment are fulfilled. Except the PartyRoom is not in a different scene (if that is against the requirement) and the water in the oasis is so shallow that the player can walk in with his/her head above water (otherwise it will be difficult to get close to sea creatures).

3. I took some online tutorials, like the camera touch control tutorial. I also learned NPC AI (NavMeshAgent) from Unity API documentation. The creature model is constructed using Blender.

I failed to implement my own joystick. I use the online joystick asset.

4. Nielsen usability heuristics

Visibility of System Status:
The health bar + current health value is on top of the screen so users can know their current health status.
The Party room button is on the upper-right corner of the screen. The party room includes 6 orbiting platforms so users know their current collections.
Creatures' different sights are marked by a transparent sphere.

Match Between the System and the Real World:
Words on the buttons precisely define their functionality.
Gravity applying to all mass objects follows real-world physics.
Aggressive creatures will chase the player.
Land creatures walk around randomly seeking food.

User Control and Freedom:
Users can jump, walk, and rotate freely.


Flexibility and Efficiency of Use:
UI appears only when needed.

Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:
Users can just drag blank areas to rotate the camera.
